# OrganisationNation
A tool for Organising teams.

## Setup
Make sure you have Node.js installed. You can download it here: https://nodejs.org/en/. Once installed, simply clone the repo and store the contents somewhere in a folder.

## Operation

Simply run the 'launch.bat' file.

## Contribution

The code for the actual web server is located under server.js. All HTML/CSS documents are in the 'views' directory, and we use the ejs format. The content for the actual application is located under the 'app' directory.

We use Semi-colon at the end of each line for Javascript, and braces go on the next line.
