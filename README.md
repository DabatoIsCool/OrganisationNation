# OrganisationNation
A tool for Organising teams.

## Setup
Make sure you have Node.js installed. You can download it here: https://nodejs.org/en/. Once installed, simply clone the repo and store the contents somewhere in a folder. Then run setup.bat.

## Operation

Simply run the 'launch.bat' file. It is hosted on localhost:3000

## Contribution

The code for the actual web server is located under server.js. All HTML documents are in the 'views' directory, and we use the ejs format. The content for the actual application is located under the 'app' directory. The CSS files are in public/css/

We use Semi-colon at the end of each line for Javascript, and braces go on the next line.
